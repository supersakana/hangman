### About this game

This is a project I created to pratice serialization and file manipulation. My goal was to organize this code in an Object Oriented way and still execute the new concepts I learned through TOP (The Odin Project) curriculum.

Enjoy and if you have feedback please contact me. I would love to know how I can improve!
